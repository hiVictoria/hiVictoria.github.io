        <p>‚ÄúVictoria's work on the post-acute HIMSS slides has been very impressive, even earning comments of ‚Äòdelightful‚Äô and ‚Äòbeautiful‚Äô from [Senior VP]. She translated some rough image ideas into truly beautiful graphics representing hand-stitched people, service lines, etc. She is very responsive to feedback and has showcased impressive artistic talent as part of this work. I forget she has only been here about 7 months - she clearly has artistic skills, but has also been able to use those to represent sometimes abstract healthcare-related ideas on the first try, every time I ask her to do something."</p>
        <p class="cite">Product Lead</p>
        <p>‚ÄúVictoria recently designed an eye-catching poster to display our team motto in the design spaces. She asked great questions up front. She edited the content so it would fit a nice layout, explored multiple different concepts, and even got feedback from other UXDs during her design process. I was impressed that she was so thorough and detailed with this project (while not getting too sucked in!) and the final outcome is beautiful."</p>

        <p>‚ÄúVictoria actively communicates what her timelines are and give accurate estimates for how long things will take. Additionally, she asks for feedback when sending me designs and is also very hands on with the AWM project by making sure she does everything she needs do to help move the project forward. Victoria often exceeds my expectations by making designs that are both visually pleasing and appropriate for the workflow context. She‚Äôs also not afraid to experiment when I give her a more general idea of what I need. Oftentimes, it looks better than what I imagined."</p>
        <p class="cite">Developer</p>

        <p>‚ÄúI've worked with Victoria across 3 projects so far and she's been very diligent both in keeping devs in the loop with design decisions and giving ad-hoc feedback on our design decisions. She's particularly good at making sure we, as devs, can keep moving forward with the design process when it seems like things are reaching a standstill by mapping out next steps for us and volunteering her help to create mockups."</p>
        <p class="cite">Developer</p>

        <p>"Victoria was a pleasure to work with and gave helpful and easily actionable feedback for my dashboard project that gave us a good set of next steps on the project team."</p>
        <p class="cite">Implementation Service Engineer</p>

        <p>"I have worked with Victoria designing/revising portions of my project, and she has done a great job being flexible and explaining her UI decisions on the fly. She has been responsive and easy to work with, and I look forward to working with her while designing for Rover."</p>
